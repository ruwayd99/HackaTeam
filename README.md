Hackathon Pairing Website

How to start the server in localhost (port 3000)

-   Git clone the repo

-   Make sure node.js is installed in the device

-   We deployed the server using supervisor

-   Run the app.js file

What it does:

-   Generally: create a personal profile (with skills, seriousness, level of hackathon experience, 

-   Algorithm that is going to display users similar to your taste! 

-   If you find someone, easily connect with them!

Functionalities:

-   Sign up and login page for user (they need a unique username) 

-   All information stored in MongoDB database

-   Passwords are hashed 

-   After sign up, users are prompted for more information 

-   All information are stored in the database

-   Afterwards, user gets to the mainpage where they can see the top 3 hackers that best matches with their personal profile

 Things to consider (for future- we couldn't do a lot of the things due to time crunch sob):

-   Allow hackers to view teams, leave a team

-   Icons for socials

-   Allow hackers to display a video to pitch themselves

-   Affiliations: Do we need Hackathons to put their hackathon on our platform before users can join, or do we want users to be able to just write a hackathon name and join (unaffiliated)
